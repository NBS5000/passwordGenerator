### ⭐ ⭐ S.T.A.R. ⭐ ⭐

**SITUATION**

The provided user story was: 

> <span style="font-style:italic">AS AN employee with access to sensitive data</span>
> 
> <span style="font-style:italic">I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria</span>
>
> <span style="font-style:italic">SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security</span>

**TASK**

Provide a solution so that the user can set various criteria and be provided with a password that meets the criteria.

**ACTION**

A full review of the code, resulting in:
* Layout
  * *Layout is responsive and functional on various screen sizes*
  * *Simple, yet attractive design*
  * *Logical layout*
  * *Improved code visualisation - eg: indentation*
  * *Error free loading*
  * *Favicon designed and added*
  * *Thorough comments*
  * *Intuitive design with error handling and user feedback if mistakes made*
* Javascript
  * *Error free performance*
  * *Multiple functions to separate aspects of code*
* GIT
  * *Numerous commits to track changes in code*
  * *Code added to public repository and Github Pages for public viewing*

**RESULT**

The end code is stored on Github, and publicly available and viewable. Accessibility functionality has been added, links have been fixed, code has been optimised, and the UI exceeds 90% similarity. This result meets all requirements of the User Story and acceptance criteria:

* ~~GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards~~
* ~~WHEN I view the source code~~
* ~~THEN I find semantic HTML elements~~
* ~~WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements~~
* ~~THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning~~
* ~~WHEN I view the icon and image elements~~
* ~~THEN I find accessible alt attributes~~
* ~~WHEN I view the heading attributes~~
* ~~THEN they fall in sequential order~~
* ~~WHEN I view the title element~~
* ~~THEN I find a concise, descriptive title~~
